## VBCorLib v1\.2\.2 \(Updated \- Included compiled html help file\)


</div>

### Description

Yes, another version! I blame Richard Mewett j/k ;) This version has been updated with features from .NET 2.0! A few new classes have been added, and an enourmous set of enhancements to some of the existing classes. With enhancements to such classes as Console, you have full control over the console window, including colors, cursors, and screen buffer sizes. The Environment has been extended to work closer with Environment Variables, such as setting them, and where to set/get them, such as Machine wide, User wide, or current process. cArray has been enhanced for advanced array searching using user-defined callbacks allowing direct access to the array elements. Such things as File allow for one-stop reading and writing to/from a file, or the Registry class to read/write to the registry in one shot. New classes such as DriveInfo allow querying information from different drives, such as the type, volume name, free space, total space, ect... Way too many things. Visit http://www.kellyethridge.com/vbcorlib to read the documentation and visit the blog to see what's always going on. And if you have any ideas, don't hesitate to let me know. This zip file does NOT include the unit tests. I wasn't sure if people were having problems setting up SimplyVBUnit. Please enjoy!
